The performance monitoring and analysis of these systems provide insights leading to improvements in system design and implementation in order to ensure high quality and robust energy supply in remote locations. Most small solar home systems now use charge controllers using pulse width modulation (PWM) to regulate the charge current to the battery. A rapid variation in current and voltage resulting from PWM creates monitoring challenges, which, if not carefully considered in the design of the monitoring system, can result in the erroneous measurement of photovoltaic (PV) power. In order to characterize and clarify the measurement process during PWM, a mathematical model was developed to reproduce and simulate measured data. The effects of matched scan and PWM frequency were studied with the model, and an algorithm was devised to select appropriate scan rates to ensure that a representative sample of measurements is acquired. Furthermore, estimation methods were developed to correct for measurement errors due to factors such as nonzero ""short circuit"" voltage and current/voltage peak mismatches. A more sophisticated algorithm is then discussed to more accurately measure PV power using highly programmable data loggers. The results produced by the various methods are compared and reveal a significant error in the measurement of PV power without corrective action. Estimation methods prove to be effective in certain cases but are susceptible to error during conditions of variable irradiance. The effect of the measurement error has been found to depend strongly on the duty cycle of PWM as well as the relationship between scan rate and PWM frequency. The energy measurement error over 1 day depends on insolation and system conditions as well as on system design. On a sunny day, under a daily load of about 20 A h, the net error in PV energy is found to be 1%, whereas a system with a high initial battery state of charge under similar conditions and no load produced an error of 47.6%. This study shows the importance of data logger selection and programming in monitoring accurately the energy provided by solar home systems. When appropriately considered, measurement errors can be avoided or reduced without investment in more expensive measurement equipment. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.",Export Date: 03 September 2023; Cited By: 11,10.1115/1.4003586,measuring errors;monitoring;pulse width modulation;solar home system;Algorithms;Design;Developing countries;Energy utilization;Estimation;Instruments;Investments;Lead acid batteries;Mathematical models;Measurement errors;Modulation;Potential flow;Pulse width modulation;Solar buildings;Solar energy;Systems analysis;Battery state of charge;Charge control;Charge controllers;Charge current;Corrective actions;Data logger;Developing world;Duty cycles;Electrical services;Energy measurements;Estimation methods;Grid extension;High costs;High quality;Measured data;Measurement equipment;Measurement process;Measuring errors;Monitoring system;No load;Performance monitoring and analysis;Pulse width;PV energy;Rapid variation;Remote location;Representative sample;Robust energy;Rural energy;Scan rates;Short circuit;System conditions;System design;Monitoring,,

The New Energy Center of National Taiwan University has been devoted to the development of a PWM charging technique to continue charging the lead-acid battery after the overcharge point to increase the battery storage capacity by more than 10%. The present study intends to use the super-capacitor to further increase the charge capacity before the overcharge point of the battery. The super-capacitor is connected in parallel to the lead-acid battery. This will reduce the overall charging impedance during the charge and increase the charging current, especially in sunny weather. A system dynamics model of the lead-acid battery and super-capacitor was derived and the control system simulation was carried out to predict the charging performance for various weathers. It shows that the overall battery impedance decreases and charging power increases with increasing solar radiation. An outdoor comparative test for two identical PV systems with and without supercapacitor was carried out. The use of super-capacitor is shown to be able to increase the lead-acid charging capacity by more than 25% at sunny weather and 10% in cloudy weather. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.",Export Date: 03 September 2023; Cited By: 1,10.1007/978-3-642-17387-5_15,battery charging;solar charging;stand-alone solar PV power;supercapacitor charging;Capacitors;Computer simulation;Sun;Charging performance;Charging techniques;Control system simulations;National Taiwan University;Solar charging;Stand-alone solar PV power;Super-capacitor charging;System dynamics model;Charging (batteries),,

Currently, there are many renewable energies, including sunlight. With the presence of solar panels, we can harvest sunlight as electricity for a charging system. In the future, renewable energy sources are something urgent and also need to think about how to do fast charging. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the charging characteristics of an off-grid solar panel system at different voltages for several types of loads. In the experiment, we use 100 Wp of solar panels, 10 Ampere of solar charge controller (SCC) with pulse width modulation (PWM) system, 100 Ah 12 Volt of a valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) battery, and 100 Watt of a lamp as a load. By changing the settings on the solar charge controller, the voltage and current will change which will affect how fast energy is transferred from the solar panel to the load. The results show that for the solar panels with battery load, the increase in voltage will be followed by an increase in current as well as power transferred linearly. However, not for a full load, this is not due to losses in SCC but due to the limited power of the photovoltaic.

Given this scenario, it is essential to implement energy efficient technology to meet our energy requirements. Along this line of thought, came about the idea of solar powered LED street lighting system. It is evident from the title, the system is powered by a solar panel. LED lamps have very low energy consumption and high efficiency, thus are used as the lighting source. The output from the solar panel is fed to a charge controller which feeds a lead acid battery. The battery has a monitor circuit to show its current status of available charge. The voltage supplied by the battery needs to be reduced to a value suited to light up an LED array. For this purpose a buck converter is used. In order to complement the energy efficient nature of the system, a dimmer circuit is introduced. This circuit is used to adjust the brightness of the LED array in accordance with the surrounding brightness in real time. This is achieved via PWM technique. PWM pulses are sent to the switch of the buck converter. Based on the width of the pulse received, the buck converter supplies a certain amount of output voltage to the LED array. Thus on varying the width of the pulse supplied, the voltage supplied to the LED array and in turn it's brightness can be controlled, according to the existing brightness outside. © International Science Press.",Export Date: 03 September 2023; Cited By: 0,,Dimmer with intensity control;LED driver;LED street lighting;Solar energy,,

To reduce dependence on the use of fossil fuels, the use of solar energy with solar panels equipped with batteries as electrical energy storage is the best alternative solution as a renewable energy source. In practice, if nonlinear solar panels are connected directly to the battery, the battery will be damaged quickly and will not last long. To overcome this, a controller which is called Solar Charge Controller (SCC) was designed so that it can regulate the voltage and current according to the condition of the battery charging phase. The voltage and current signals are regulated using the pulse width modulation (PWM) method. The design includes a 20 Wp solar panel as a power source, a buck converter is used as a voltage reducer, and electrical energy is stored in a 12 V battery with a capacity of 3 Ah and there are sensors to measure voltage and current.

The battery charging control is thus usually designed to stop charging after the overcharge point. This will reduce the storage energy capacity and reduce the service time in electricity supply. The design of charging control system however requires a good understanding of the system dynamic behaviour of the battery first. In the present study, a first-order system dynamics model of lead-acid battery at different operating points near the overcharge voltage was derived experimentally, from which a charging control system based on PI algorithm was developed using PWM charging technique. The feedback control system for battery charging after the overcharge point (14 V) was designed to compromise between the set-point response and the disturbance rejection. The experimental results show that the control system can suppress the battery voltage overshoot within 0.1 V when the solar irradiation is suddenly changed from 337 to 843 W/m2. A long-term outdoor test for a solar LED lighting system shows that the battery voltage never exceeded 14.1 V for the set point 14 V and the control system can prevent the battery from overcharging. The test result also indicates that the control system is able to increase the charged energy by 78%, as compared to the case that the charging stops after the overcharge point (14 V). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Efforts are recently being dedicated to developing models that seek to provide insights into that issue. However, not all models consider the operation of the photovoltaic (PV) battery storage system with regard to battery optimization and temperature effects. The present work provides a controllable algorithm to help charge controllers provide exact amount of PV electricity (charge equalization) to batteries with temperature compensation included, and a proposed charging and discharging schedules of the battery storage. The temperature compensated duty cycle for charging is modelled and the pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal is programmed to change with temperature following this duty cycle model. This research work is based on the optimization of solar battery storage where the micro controller-based charge controller enhances battery life by monitoring the temperature and controlling charging voltages and float charging voltages for specific temperatures. A buck converter was simulated in Proteus, and then realized in the laboratory. The duty cycle of the buck converter was adjusted with temperature. Results collected from lab experiments were plotted on MatLab and it shows homogeneity with calculated results. Moreover, battery-charging currents, battery direct current (DC) disconnect and battery switching for charging and discharging were performed for the converter. Future work is to extend this study to large-scale solar photovoltaic systems in order to overcome the operation limits encountered. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",Export Date: 03 September 2023; Cited By: 1,10.1051/e3sconf/202235401003,"",,

It is crucial to select the right charge controller. It is designed considering the non-linear characteristics of the PV panel and the charging and discharging profile of the battery. The charge controllers are designed on MATLAB/Simulink and then implemented with hardware. There are three types of charge controllers: the basic charge controller using voltage regulator, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) based and the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) based charge controllers. Each charge controller works best for a set of parameters. Thus, parameters such as panel's voltage/current rating, cost,operating temperature etc. are taken into consideration for choosing the right charge controller. The basic charge controller results in inefficient charging of the battery, thus, the PWM based and the MPPT based charge controllers are designed. © 2019 IEEE.","Export Date: 03 September 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Manoella""=>""Included""}",10.1109/WITCONECE48374.2019.9092912,MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking);PV(Photovoltaic);PWM (Pulse Width Modulation);Charging (batteries);Lead acid batteries;MATLAB;Maximum power point trackers;Photovoltaic cells;Professional aspects;Pulse width modulation;Solar power generation;Voltage control;Voltage regulators;Charge controllers;Comparative analysis;MATLAB /simulink;Maximum Power Point Tracking;Nonlinear characteristics;Operating temperature;Photovoltaic;Solar charge controller;Controllers,,
